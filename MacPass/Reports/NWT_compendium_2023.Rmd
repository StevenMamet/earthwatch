## Long-term ecological and geomorphological investigations in the alpine tundra of the Mackenzie Mountains, NWT  

<br>

The goal of this project was to study recent permafrost thaw and evaluate limitations to treeline advance coincident with climate change in the western Mackenzie/eastern Selwyn Mountains. Annual air temperatures at our 5 weather stations have warmed by `r ann_temp_increase`°C per decade since 1990, with warming occurring faster during winter (`r win_temp_increase`°C per decade). The 1990–`r field_year` weather record from the 5 weather stations shows an increase of about `r sum_win_perma_increase`°C in both summer and winter permafrost temperatures. Warming appears to have accelerated permafrost thaw, with increases varying from `r low_thaw` centimetres per decade in low elevation sites, to greater than `r high_thaw` centimetres per decade at high elevations. Wetter areas and permafrost features with shrub cover were prone to thicker depths of thaw, though the latter had slower increases in thaw rates through time. As temperatures rise and permafrost thaws, Arctic landscapes will change, sometimes abruptly, and the current plant and animal residents may find themselves unable to adapt. The treeline was the other major focus of this research. Warmer temperatures could mean that more trees can grow farther north or further upslope in mountainous areas. In 2016–2019, the researcher planted tree seeds in some areas to see if they would grow. Surveys of these seeds in `r field_year` suggest that south-facing alpine slopes may be ideal environments for new trees to establish. However, there appear to be three apparent limitations to treeline expansion: 1) existing trees along the Canol Trail do not currently produce enough good seed to colonize new areas, 2) seeds in shrubby areas are quickly predated by small mammals, and 3) young tree seedlings are outcompeted by other vegetation before they can grow into adult trees. Cages placed over the planted seeds at treeline indicated seeds would be mostly devoured by animals if not protected by the cages, limiting treeline advance. Further monitoring is necessary to determine if current patterns of tree growth and permafrost thaw will continue into the foreseeable future.
