   abstract = {Decay of palsas can indicate permafrost status, particularly in regions where air temperatures have increased rapidly in recent decades. Using weather data, annual surveys of active-layer thickness, and analyses of high-resolution aerial imagery from the eastern Selwyn/western Mackenzie Mountains, NT, Canada, we show that permafrost temperatures have increased, active layers have deepened, and palsa areal extents have decreased considerably since the 1940s. High-altitude palsas thawed quickly from the 1940s to the 1980s, although some low-altitude palsas have recently decreased rapidly in areal extent due to peat-block calving. The linear rate of increasing active-layer thickness may not be congruent with the non-linear rate of areal loss of palsas. The rapid and episodic collapse of palsas at some sites highlights the necessity to consider hydrology, vegetation cover, landscape position, and morphology in palsa dynamics in addition to a warming climate.

   abstract = {zoo is an R package providing an S3 class with methods for indexed totally ordered observations, such as discrete irregular time series. Its key design goals are independence of a particular index/time/date class and consistency with base R and the "ts" class for regular time series. This paper describes how these are achieved within zoo and provides several illustrations of the available methods for "zoo" objects which include plotting, merging and binding, several mathematical operations, extracting and replacing data and index, coercion and NA handling. A subclass "zooreg" embeds regular time series into the "zoo" framework and thus bridges the gap between regular and irregular time series classes in R.},
